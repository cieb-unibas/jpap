Forschungsschwerpunkte des Instituts liegen bei zoonotischen Helminthosen (Echinococcose, Fasciolose), und protozoren Aborterregern (Neosporose, Toxoplasmose, Tritrichomonose). Der Fokus liegt hierbei auf der Entwicklung neuer Behandlungsmethoden gegen die genannten Erkrankungen. Mehr Informationen zu unserem Institut sind hier zu finden: http://www.ipa.vetsuisse.unibe.ch. Hintergrund zum Forschungsprojekt: Alveolre Echinococcose (AE) ist eine Infektion der Leber mit dem larvalen Stadium (Metazestode) des Fuchsbandwurmes Echinococcus multilocularis. Diese Metazestoden sind durch tumorartiges, infiltratives Wachstum charakterisiert, wobei es zu Metastasenbildung in anderen Organen kommen kann. Unbehandelt fhrt diese Infektion sowohl bei Menschen als auch bei Hunden, Affen, und anderen Tieren zum Tod. Medikaments heilbar ist die AE jedoch nicht. Die heute verwendeten Medikamente haben nur parasitostatische Wirkung und sind nicht in der Lage, den Parasiten abzutten. Daher wird dringend nach neuen Medikamenten gesucht. In unserem Labor verwenden wir die in vitro Kultur des Parasiten fr das Screening von Wirkstoffen zur Identifizierung und Charakterisierung neuer therapeutischer Mglichkeiten sowie zur Erforschung grundlegender zell- und molekularbiologischer Fragestellungen der AE. Diese werden mittels Transkriptom-, Proteom- und Metabolomanalysen ergnzt. Unser Fokus liegt hierbei auf dem mitochondriellen Energiemetabolismus des Parasiten, sowie auf der Wirts-Parasit-Interaktion. Ausgewhlte Themen werden auch im Mausmodell weiterverfolgt.

Es kann dabei allerdings zu Verzögerungen kommen. Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis. 100%, Zurich, fixed-term This project is part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the groups of Prof. Klaus Eyer (functional single cell readouts, ETH Zurich), Prof. Helmuth Gehart (tumor and stem cell biology, ETH Zurich), and Prof. Kruithof-de Julio (urological research laboratory, Inselspital/UBERN). The advertised position will be evenly shared between the laboratories of Prof. Eyer and Prof. Gehart and exist at the interface of engineering and tumor biology. The Laboratory for Functional Immune Repertoire Analysis (Prof. Klaus Eyer, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, ETH Zurich) focuses on developing and applying technologies and analytical strategies that allow us to measure, describe and exploit the functionality of individual cells and systems. Our research currently centers around various fundamental and applied scientific questions for vaccine-mediated protection and personalized medicine. We combine chemical, physical, engineering, and biological aspects in our interdisciplinary approach to achieve our aims. Prof. Dr. Helmuth Gehart (Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, ETH Zurich) is an expert in organoid technology, stem cell biology, and single-cell techniques. He co-developed several new organoid systems (e.g., human liver organoids), integrated single-cell readouts in vitro and in vivo, and currently pioneers nanoliter-droplet organoid cultures. The Gehart research group combines in vivo and in vitro techniques to study the mechanisms of stem cell control and cancer biology to reinvigorate exhausted tissue regeneration and stop the progression of malignant disease. Our laboratories are located on the Hönggerberg Campus in Zürich (Switzerland). Project background Tumoroids serve as excellent in vitro avatars for individual patients due to their ability to reflect the inherent heterogeneity in the tumor of origin. This makes the system particularly suitable for personalized medicine, patient stratification, and evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic approaches. As a result, multiple studies have shown that in vitro drug responses of tumoroids are predictive for the success or failure of a particular treatment strategy in a patient. Despite these impressive results, all organoid assays suffer from the same limitation: The biopsy takes 2-3 months to identify tumor-specific vulnerabilities. Although this is acceptable (though still not ideal) for genetic diseases with slow progression, waiting times of several months are incompatible with the swift therapeutic decisions that have to be taken for cancer treatment. In this project, we want to dramatically decrease this time and accelerate the detection of vulnerabilities and personalize therapies. Job description We offer a funded Postdoctoral position as part of the ETH strategic focus area Personalized Health and Related Technologies. The project aims to adapt and combine the work performed in our two laboratories into an automated and integrated prototype that overcomes the current limitations in organoid screenings. This project aims to study specific vulnerabilities and the survival of individual patient-derived organoids and xenografts, intending to apply these novel methods in clinical practice in the future. To achieve the goals and facilitate clinical translation, we have set up an interdisciplinary research program together with Prof Dr. Marianna Kruithof-de Julio (Dept. of Urology, University Hospital, Bern and Dept. for BioMedical Research, University of Bern, Head of the Urology Research Laboratory and leading expert in prostate cancer stem-cell biology). Your profile The interdisciplinary aspect is central in our group and within this collaboration. You should have a strong disposition to learn and improve novel methods and be open to different research disciplines. Expertise in: programming microfluidics mechanical engineering or prototype generation is required and prior experience with optical methods and standard methods of molecular biology are helpful We are looking for an ambitious team player that can successfully navigate within this collaboration. We offer you an intellectually challenging position in the inspiring atmosphere of an interdisciplinary team and in our collaborations, and the prospect to develop and translate a prototype into clinical practice. Advanced training in different related fields and participation at international conferences is highly encouraged. You must communicate in English (oral and written) fluently and be willing to work in a highly interactive, interdisciplinary, diverse, and international team.

Es kann dabei allerdings zu Verzögerungen kommen. Vielen Dank für Ihr Verständnis. PhD position: geospatial methods for resource assessments of renewable energy technologies 100%, Zurich, fixed-term The Chair of Energy Systems Analysis (ESA), within the Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering at ETH Zurich, is looking for a doctoral student working on geospatial methods for resource assessments of renewable energy technologies. The PhD position is well connected with other research projects at ESA, which is at the intersection of engineering and economics, and involves developing and applying energy system models to diverse energy systems and research questions. The ESA group is headed by Prof. Dr. Russell McKenna and generally focuses on the energy system analysis of low carbon energy systems and technologies. The Chair holder’s joint appointment as the Head of the Laboratory of Energy Systems Analysis at PSI mean a strong collaboration with this group is also desirable. Project background The transition to a net-zero-carbon-emissions (net-zero) energy system requires a significant increase in renewable generation capacity with respect to current values. This requires detailed data relating to the costs and potentials of diverse energy technologies, which reflect present and possible future constraints from diverse stakeholders. Job description The goal of the project is to develop geospatial methods and tools to perform resource assessments for renewable energy technologies, at scales from solar PV on individual buildings to onshore wind for whole continents. This will be done, for example: by improving existing methods of resource assessments to better reflect non-technical constraints such as social acceptance or environmental impacts; by exploiting open data sources such as Open Street Map to develop transferable tools and methods for local resource assessments; by accounting for land use competition between technologies and where appropriate to assess the potential for mixed-use or hybrid power plants; by developing user interfaces with which diverse stakeholders may directly interact with detailed energy system data and perform their own resource assessments; by adopting state-of-the-art modeling techniques to simulate the future spatial and temporal evolutions of highly-renewable energy systems; by combining static resource assessment with dynamic energy system models in order to explore short- and long term developments in technology characteristics. To address these points, you will have access to state-of-the-art computational capabilities, and you will be in contact with experts within ETH Zurich and worldwide. Your profile We are looking for a proactive and highly motivated candidate, with a MSc in a quantitative discipline (such as engineering, applied physics, geosciences or mathematics) from an internationally recognized University and an excellent academic track record. Ideally, you have a background in quantitative modelling and programming (e.g. Matlab, Python, Julia, GAMS, GIS). Knowledge of mixed method approaches, mixed-integer linear programming solvers (e.g. CPLEX, Gurobi) and/or machine learning techniques are a benefit. You should be able to speak and write clearly in English. Furthermore, you will need to enjoy working in a competitive, dynamic, diverse, and international environment with other doctoral students and postdocs. ETH Zurich ETH Zurich is one of the world’s leading universities specialising in science and technology. We are renowned for our excellent education, cutting-edge fundamental research and direct transfer of new knowledge into society.
